   <!--
        This file is designed to be included in a build.xml

        It defines the standard scala ant tasks with a classpath
        that includes everything in the (now-unbundled) Scala library
        that's found at ${scala.local}/lib

        It also defines a macro task that makes a (locally)
        java-runnable jar file from class files in ${build.dir}.
