# App/Opt 

## Parsing arguments for Scala command-line applications

An `App` is the core of a command-line application.  Its `Options`
must be declared as a list of the `Opt`s that it is prepared to
accept on the commandline.  Its `Command` is the name it is known
by.  Its `Main` is invoked when the command-line options have been
parsed. Many of its methods can be overridden.

Every `Opt` is associated with a pattern and an arity (usually
between 1 and 2) and a meaning function. The subclasses of `Opt`
defined here provide a useful selection of meaning functions (and
their associated arities).

When an `App` starts, the list of command line arguments

        arg1 arg2 ...

is parsed by finding a declared option whose pattern matches `arg1`,
then taking `arity` arguments (including `arg1`) and passing them
to a suitable function, usually one that sets a particular
variable. Then `arity` arguments are removed from
the list, and the parsing continues. The parsing stops when there
are no arguments left (or when a parsing error occurs).

If the pattern starts with a single quote `"'"` then it is interpreted
(without the `"'"`) as a literal. If the pattern ends with `"="`
then it is also interpreted as a literal, except that it matches a
command line argument that it prefixes, and the remainder of that
argument (after the "=") is treated as if it had been given as an
additional argument. This is (mostly) indended for parsing options
of the form `--opt=`*argument*

Importing (all) the `OPT._` macros provides a very convenient way to 
construct variable-setting functions for variables of most types:
it's only necessary to mention the variable that is to be set, and
the macro does the rest.

See below for a simple and effective way of using the `App/Opt`
packages to accumulate a queue of jobs to be performed by the program
(and the environments in which each job is to be performed). The Job
queue is available when the options and paths have all been parsed
-- but not before. An error in parsing causes the program to exit
*before any "semantic" processing has been done.*
